### 👑 KING — Cosmic Snap Profile (Final)
- Cinematic **Gauntlet snap** animation with a **quick, cosmic 'KING' hologram** that appears instantly and turns to dust — looped for effect.
- Static **galaxy background** (stars & nebula), gold gauntlet, glowing Infinity Stones.
- **Quick** hologram duration so it feels like the snap (appears ~0.1s after the flash and fades within ~0.9s).

#### 📁 Files in this repo
- `README.md` (this file)  
- `gauntlet-snap-final.svg` (animated SVG used above)

#### 📦 How to upload
1. Create a repo named exactly with your GitHub username (e.g., `ME-KING`).  
2. Upload these two files to the repo root: `README.md` and `gauntlet-snap-final.svg`.  
3. Commit and view your profile — the animation will show in the README.

> Note: GitHub displays SVG images in READMEs. If you want the image smaller or larger, change the `width` attribute in the `<img ...>` tag.

If you'd like tiny tweaks (faster snap, longer holo, different colors, "KING" centered differently), tell me and I’ll update it instantly.  
Enjoy — KING 👑✨
